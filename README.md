## Overview of UFOs Analysis
### Updating Danaâ€™s UFO webpage and dynamic table so it can allow users to filter through multiple criteria of UFO sightings at the same time. That criteria includes table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## UFO Results:
### This webpage is very user friendly and gives the user the ability to search UFO sightings in many ways. For instance, if the user is only interested in the state that sightings have occurred then they can easily use the "State" filter and choose the state they are interested in. They also have the ability to filter by date, city, country and even shape. The user can perform a search by simply inputting the criteria they are interested in, like searching by states, and then the table to the right will auto populate the results. This will provide a great user experience and give them the exact information they are looking for. 

## Summary:
### Drawback: 
- A drawback of this page is that the data will not be current after a few years and would need to be manually updated as opposed to live data. 
### Additional Recommendations:
- I would recommend adding another search filter for the duration criteria. This would need to be done in increments of 5 min but it would be interesting information to search through to see how long UFO sightings typically are.
- I would also recommend putting in a an interactive graph that would update based on the current search criteria. This would give people a visual way of seeing the search results.
